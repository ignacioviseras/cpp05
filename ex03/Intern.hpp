// Since filling out forms all day would be too cruel for our bureaucrats, interns exist to
// take on this tedious task. In this exercise, you must implement the Intern class. The
// intern has no name, no grade, and no unique characteristics. The only thing bureaucrats
// care about is that they do their job.
// However, the intern has one key ability: the makeForm() function. This function
// takes two strings as parameters: the first one represents the name of a form, and the
// second one represents the target of the form. It returns a pointer to a AForm object
// (corresponding to the form name passed as a parameter), with its target initialized to
// the second parameter.
// It should print something like:
// Intern creates <form>
// If the provided form name does not exist, print an explicit error message.

// You must avoid unreadable and messy solutions, such as using an excessive if/elseif/else structure. This kind of approach will not be accepted during the evaluation
// process. Youâ€™re not in the Piscine (pool) anymore. As usual, you must test everything
// to ensure it works as expected.
// For example, the following code creates a RobotomyRequestForm targeted at
// "Bender":

// {
// 	Intern someRandomIntern;
// 	AForm* rrf;
// 	rrf = someRandomIntern.makeForm("robotomy request", "Bender");
// }
